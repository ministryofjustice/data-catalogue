# You must specify at least one collection of datasets. Some users may find it helpful to think of this as a "database"
example_prison_data_product:
  # model can be "domain" or "tabular"
  model: "tabular"
  # Add a description for your collection to help users find it.
  # This is optional, as the data product description will also aid discoverability.
  description: "Extracted from the Offender Management Statistics Quarterly publication - Adjudications data. Please refer to notes in that publication."
  # limitations are optional, but you might want to tell users what they CAN'T do with this data
  limitations:
  # If versioning is enabled, the Data Platform will store a historical snaphot of the database each time an update is sent.
  # This can add SIGNIFICANTLY to storage costs, so you may be asked to justify this.

  tables:
    # Your database must contain at least one table. Each table must contain at least one column. If the data is time-based,
    # please indicate which column is the primary date value using the "primary-period: true" attribute.
