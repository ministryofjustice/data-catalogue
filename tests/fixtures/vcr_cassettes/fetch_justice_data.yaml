        <p class=\\\"govuk-body\\\">More serious offences (triable either-way or indictable
        only) are passed via the magistrates' court on to the Crown Court, either
        for sentencing after the defendant has been found guilty or for a trial with
        a judge and jury. The Crown Court also receives appeals against decisions
        of the magistrates' courts.</p> <p class=\\\"govuk-body\\\">The magistrates'
        court is the first tier of criminal courts in England and Wales and is presided
        over by three \u2018Justices of the Peace\u2019 (known as lay magistrates)
        or by a district judge.</p> <p class=\\\"govuk-body\\\">The Crown Court is
        a single entity that sits at various court centres across England and Wales,

        disputes in particular areas of law. Appeals to tribunals are generally against
        a decision made by a government department or agency. The main exception to
        this is the employment tribunal where cases are on a party v party basis (specifically,
        employee versus employer). There are tribunals in England, Wales, Scotland
        and Northern Ireland covering a wide range of areas affecting day-to-day life.
