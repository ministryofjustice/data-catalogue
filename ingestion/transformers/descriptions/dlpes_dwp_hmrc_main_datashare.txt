The overarching aim of this share is to improve our
understanding of the potential links between offending, employment and
benefits.

The share includes anyone who appears on the Police National Computer with
at least one caution or conviction for a recordable offence in England and
Wales since 2000 and who can be successfully matched onto DWP/HMRC records.

This data is matched onto DWP benefit records and HMRC employment records
held on RAPID from 2008. The share is updated every two to three years.
